So to make these work we need to follow these steps ig ...
    
    set up py env if u need 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    install ollama from official site 
    install ollama 
    run command ollama pull mistral
    check if the model is succeffully pulled by command ollama list 
    Then run python rag_llm.py 
    The output will be saved to output_final.py 

Note : i have not uploaded ./vector_db so after pulling add a folder called Pdfs and add all needed pdfs there 
       Then while running the the file it will promt whether any pdfs added or not ....give yes and continue it will automatically create vector vector_db
       enjoy !!
